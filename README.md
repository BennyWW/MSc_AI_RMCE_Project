# Project Title: 
INVESTIGATING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PERSONALITY TRAITS, VIDEOGAME PREFERENCES, AND GAME ENVIRONMENT USING MACHINE LEARNING AND GENETIC ALGORITHMS.

# Abstract: 
Our personalities can dictate how we perceive ourselves, others, our surroundings, and gaming preferences or choices. The relationship between the Big Five (OCEAN) or FFM personality traits and videogame preferences has been investigated by several research studies where relationships between the two have been discovered. Player-centric game design has grown in popularity along with Procedural Content Generation (PCG). The incorporation of the personality-game preference relationship into player-centric game development has not been fully exploited. This study aims to identify personality profiles within a large OCEAN dataset and build a prediction model with the use of Machine Learning or Deep Learning algorithms. A genetic algorithm was used to automatically generate a player-centric game environment suited for the personality profiles and a videogame was developed to visually represent the game environment and make it playable. The game was then evaluated to determine its adaptability and feasibility.
